# Meta information



Node.js simple console project that grabs npm package dependencies (essentially package.json contents). 
Uses web-crawling package page on npm website and writes down resulta to JSON file.
Worked by Fall 2020, may not work now, was made for educational properties

Project was abandoned since JS didn't have a good graph drawing library at the moment

# Usage

run **get { _package_name_ }** and if succeeded, you will find dependecies listed in _/meta/{ package_name }.json_
